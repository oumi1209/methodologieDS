# Medical Image Classification with Chest X-Ray Images using CNN 
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying chest x-ray images. The aim of the project was to build a model that could accurately detect the presence of lung diseases, such as pneumonia, in chest x-ray images.

## Tools and Libraries

This project uses the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Flask**
- **Matplotlib**
- **imbalanced-learn**

Make sure to install and set up these tools and libraries before running the project.
### Steps

1. **Read the Images:** First, you need to read the images you'll be working with. You can use various libraries like OpenCV, PIL, or scikit-image to read the images into your Python code.

2. **Pre-process and Rescale the Images:** Pre-process the images to prepare them for training and testing. This may involve resizing, normalization, data augmentation, etc.

3. **Activation Functions:** Experiment with different activation functions, such as Tanh and ReLU, in your neural network models.

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Implement your Convolutional Neural Network architecture using Keras and TensorFlow. Define the layers, architecture, and configurations of your CNN.

5. **Training the Model:** Train your model on a training dataset. Specify the number of epochs, batch size, and optimization techniques you plan to use. Include code snippets or links to relevant code files.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a test set of images. Report evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score.
