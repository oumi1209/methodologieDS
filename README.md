# Medical Image Classification with Chest X-Ray Images using CNN 
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying chest x-ray images. The aim of the project was to build a model that could accurately detect the presence of lung diseases, such as pneumonia, in chest x-ray images.
